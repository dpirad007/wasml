\begin{abstract}
  Machine learning is an integral part of the modern business as well as
  tech consumers. It is utilized by various organizations to improve their
  products for better object detection, speech detection etc. Many
  organizations now run ML models on the browser e.g. recommendation of
  videos.The most accessible way to interact with machine learning is
  through the browser. Tensorflow Js is a perfect example of using machine
  learning on the web, However, TFJS utilizes JavaScript for its
  implementation which is much slower when compared to a compiled language
  like C++/Rust.
  This project aims to create a fast machine learning library on the web
  which implements features of ML libraries and runs them at near native
  speed on the browser. It will build on modules such as a Data Analysis
  and Manipulation Tool, in which we can ingest data and manipulate it,
  process the datasets, Apply the ingested data on ML algorithms for
  clustering , reducing the dimensionality of the dataset etc all utilizing
  Rust for greater performance on the browser.
